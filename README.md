## About Tetralign
Tetralign is a Tetris-like video game developed by Nexus. Players must stack geometrically shaped blocks on top of
each other such that they fill a grid space. If the player fills an entire row within the grid, the row is cleared and
every block on top of the row is brought down. Otherwise, the blocks will continuously stack on top of each other until
there is no more room to place a block. If this occurs, the player loses and the game is finished. The blocks will fall
on their own at a predetermined rate of speed based on the current game level. As the levels progress, the blocks will
fall at a faster rate of speed. The player has the ability to speed up this process by moving the block down using the
keyboard. The player's score is determined by how many blocks the player is able to place within the time limit.
Players will have the ability to keep track of their personal high score and highest played level, and they will also be
able to see other players' highest scores and levels. Compete with your friends for the highest score!
